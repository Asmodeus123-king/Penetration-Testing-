# TryHackMe - TakeOver Lab: Walkthrough

## Overview

The "TakeOver" room on TryHackMe is a beginner-to-intermediate level challenge designed to test web reconnaissance, subdomain enumeration, and SSL certificate inspection. The ultimate goal is to identify and access a hidden subdomain hosting the flag.

---

## Objective

Utilize subdomain enumeration techniques and SSL certificate analysis to locate and access a hidden internal subdomain and retrieve the final flag.

---

## Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance

### Host Mapping

Before beginning enumeration, we map the primary domain to the target IP in /etc/hosts:


echo "10.10.XXX.XXX futurevera.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts


Visiting https://futurevera.thm yields a basic or default page. No sensitive content is immediately visible.

---

## Step 2: Subdomain Enumeration Using FFUF

To uncover hidden subdomains, we perform virtual host fuzzing using ffuf:


ffuf \
  -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million.txt \
  -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" \
  -u https://10.10.XXX.XXX \
  -fs 0,4605


### Results:

* blog.futurevera.thm
* support.futurevera.thm

These are valid subdomains identified by filtering out false responses using -fs (filter size).

Update /etc/hosts to include the discovered subdomains:


echo "10.10.XXX.XXX blog.futurevera.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "10.10.XXX.XXX support.futurevera.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts


Accessing them in the browser:

* blog.futurevera.thm: may host a WordPress/blog platform or placeholder
* support.futurevera.thm: displays a generic or placeholder page

---

## Step 3: SSL Certificate Inspection

To uncover additional internal subdomains, inspect the SSL certificate for the support.futurevera.thm site.

### Manual Browser Inspection:

* Visit https://support.futurevera.thm
* Click the padlock icon → View Certificate
* Navigate to *Subject Alternative Names (SANs)*

### Hidden SAN Entry Discovered:


secrethelpdesk934752.support.futurevera.thm


This internal subdomain is not publicly discoverable via dictionary enumeration.

---

## Step 4: Accessing the Hidden Subdomain

Map the newly discovered subdomain to the host:


echo "10.10.XXX.XXX secrethelpdesk934752.support.futurevera.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts


Access it via browser:

url
https://secrethelpdesk934752.support.futurevera.thm


This subdomain is live and hosts the CTF flag.

---

## Step 5: Retrieve the Flag

The flag is displayed directly on the web page:


flag{beea0d6edfcee06a59b83fb50ae81b2f}


---

## Tools Used

* *ffuf* – Subdomain fuzzing via virtual host header manipulation
* *Browser (Firefox/Chrome)* – SSL certificate inspection
* *Linux host tools* – Editing /etc/hosts, curl, etc.
